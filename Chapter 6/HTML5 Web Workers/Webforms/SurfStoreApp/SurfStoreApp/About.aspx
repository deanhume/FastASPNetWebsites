        About the Store
    </h2>
    <p>
        This store serves an example store for the book Fast ASP.NET Websites. For more information on the book, please visit the <a href="http://www.manning.com/hume">Manning website</a>,
        or if you would like to see the source code for the book, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/deanhume/FastASPNetWebsites">Github repo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sample surf application is a playground and experimental area that
        will allow us to take the application from a slow, poor performing website to a
        speedy high grade site.
